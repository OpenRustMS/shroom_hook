# Proxy DLL to do client modifications

## Building

Either use cross(https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) or build this library locally on a windows machine. I'd recommend setting up a Windows 7/10 VM and use SSH to develop on It remotely.

Update:
Also cross-compilable now. Toolchain and target should be set up properly via `.cargo/config.toml` and `rust-toolchain.toml` already.

## Windows Build instructions

1. Get Rust via Rustup
2. Install 32 bit nightly toolchain: `rustup toolchain install nightly-i686-pc-windows-msvc`
3. build: `cargo build --target i686-pc-windows-msvc --release`
4. Copy `target/release/dinput8.dll` to your client directory

## Usage instructions

Move the build `dinput8.dll` from the `target/release` directory to your Maple Story directory(same directory as your localhost .exe). When you launch the localhost you should see a console being opened.

## Features

* Logging Packet structure tracing data
* Dump the whole string pool
* Catch exceptions before the process is about to crash
* Skip the logo

## Overlay

Requirs `libstdc++6-.dll` and `libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll` for now because apparentely there's no way to link them statically.(https://code.google.com/archive/p/wtfu/downloads)
So the Overlay feature is optional for now, waiting for hudhook to support egui.

## 

## TODO

* Add key dumping feature
* Config(50%)
